This page provides ''step-by-step instructions'' for setting up a [http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/ EDK II] build environment on Linux using a native GCC installation (4.4+).  This EDK II setup does not require the Mingw version of GCC to be built, and therefore can be much faster to setup.

==Getting Started==

These instructions will be written as a series of commands executed from a command terminal.Often these instructions will contain a command which needs to be executed in the terminal window.  For example:

<pre>
bash$ echo this text is a sample command
</pre>

To execute this command, highlight the text of the command in your web browser.  (Note that the 'bash$' text is not part of the command!)  Most web browsers should be able to copy the text by selecting Copy under the Edit menu.  Now, change back to the terminal application, and there should be a Paste operation under the Edit menu.  After pasting the command into the shell, you may need to press the enter or return key to execute the command. 

Of course, there may be other ways to copy and paste the command into the terminal which are specific to the windowing environment and applications that you are using.  If all else fails, however, you can type the command by hand.

Some commands are very long, and we use the backslash character (\) to tell the shell program that the command is not finished.  For example:

<pre>
bash$ echo this bold text is a sample command \
        which is broken into two lines
</pre>

When you copy and paste, make sure you include all lines of the command (including the backslash (\) characters).  If you are typing the command, you can remove the backslash character (\) and combine the lines into a single line if you prefer.

If a command starts with the sudo command, then you may be prompted for your user password.  This will be the same password as you used to login to the system.

For the purposes of this set of instructions, we will be using the following paths.
{|
|Edk2 source tree: || $HOME/src/edk2
|-
|Native GCC 4.x compiler installation: || /usr/bin/gcc
|-
|Intel ASL Compiler installation: || /usr/bin/iasl
|}

You will need to change the commands if you want to use different locations, but this is not recommended unless you are sure that you know what you are doing.

===Internet proxies===

If your network utilizes a firewall with a web proxy, then you may need to configure your proxy information for various command line applications to work.  You may need to consult with your network administrator to find out the computer name and port to use for proxy setup.  The following commands are common examples of how you would configure your proxy by setting an environment variable:

<pre>
bash$ export http_proxy=http://proxy.domain.com:proxy_port
bash$ export ftp_proxy=$http_proxy
</pre>

To utilize the subversion source control command behind an internet firewall with a web proxy, you should configure the ~/.subversion/servers file.

===Ubuntu 16.04 LTS / Ubuntu 16.10===

Note: These instructions utilize GCC5 & NASM compiler support (added in early 2016), along with git (replaces subversion). GCC 4.x is still supported. GCC5 is not mandatory.

====Open the GNOME Terminal program====

These instructions will utilize Ubuntu's built in command shell (bash) via the GNOME Terminal application.  To open the Terminal application, locate it under the Applications menu and the Accessories sub-menu.

====Install required software from apt====

Several Ubuntu packages will be needed to set up the build environment for EDK II. The following command will install all required packages:

<pre>
bash$ sudo apt-get install build-essential uuid-dev iasl git gcc-5 nasm python3-distutils
</pre>

:build-essential - Informational list of build-essential packages 
:uuid-dev -  Universally Unique ID library (headers and static libraries)
:iasl - Intel ASL compiler/decompiler (also provided by acpica-tools)
:git - support for git revision control system 
:gcc-5 - GNU C compiler (v5.4.0 as of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
:nasm - General-purpose x86 assembler
:python3-distutils - distutils module from the Python standard library

==Instructions for older Linux Environments==

Note: the instructions below have not been updated for compilers newer than GCC 4.4, git (replaces subversion) or NASM. Newer builds may fail without satisfying these dependecies. We recommend moving to newer Linux distributions unless you have a dependency on a specific version.

===Note: Limitations of GCC 4.4===

Note: The GCC 4.4 toolchain only supports building images for the IA32 and X64 architectures. We recommend using newer toolchains.

Also, in some cases if GCC 4.4 is installed under Linux x86 (32-bit mode), then it may only support building UEFI images for the IA32 architecture.

===Arch Linux 2010.05===
Note: Arch Linux is not officially supported or tested by the edk2 project at this time.

====Open the GNOME Terminal program====

These instructions will utilize Arch Linux's built in command shell (bash) via the GNOME Terminal application.  To open the Terminal application, locate it under the Applications menu and the System Tools sub-menu.

====Install required software with pacman====

To install the required packages, you must be root.  Therefore we use 'su' to become the root user.

<pre>
bash$ su -
bash$ pacman -S base-devel glibc iasl python2 subversion
bash$ exit
</pre>

===Fedora 13===
Note: Fedora is not officially supported or tested by the edk2 project at this time.

Note: x86 (32-bit) Fedora will install GCC 4.4 which is only capable of building UEFI for the IA32 architecture.

====Open the GNOME Terminal program====

These instructions will utilize Fedora's built in command shell (bash) via the GNOME Terminal application.  To open the Terminal application, locate it under the Applications menu and the System Tools sub-menu.

====Install required software with yum====

To install the required packages, you must be root.  Therefore we use 'su' to become the root user.

<pre>
bash$ su -
bash$ yum groupinstall development-tools
bash$ yum install iasl libuuid-devel
bash$ exit
</pre>

Note: x86 (32-bit) Mandriva will install GCC 4.4 which is only capable of building UEFI for the IA32 architecture.

====Open the Terminal program====

These instructions will utilize Mandriva's built in command shell (bash) via the Terminal application.  To open the Terminal application, locate it under the Applications menu and the Tools sub-menu.

====Install required software with urpmi====

To install the required packages, you must be root.  Therefore we use 'su' to become the root user.

<pre>
bash$ su -
bash$ urpmi task-c++-devel iasl libuuid-devel subversion
bash$ exit
</pre>

===openSUSE 12.1===

Note: openSUSE is not officially supported or tested by the edk2 project at this time.

====Open the GNOME Terminal program====

These instructions will utilize openSUSE's built in command shell (bash) via the GNOME Terminal application.  To open the Terminal application, click the 'Computer' menu, click the 'More Applications' button, and then enter 'terminal' into the filter text box.

====Install required software with zypper====

Several openSUSE packages will be needed to fully set up an edk2 build environment.  In order to easily install all the requirements, you need to run this command.

<pre>
bash> sudo zypper in -t pattern devel_basis
</pre>

<big>
