Create a Windows based host environment for [[EmulatorPkg]].

* Difficulty: Medium
* Language: C
* Mentor:
* Suggested by: {{sfuser|andrewfish}}

= Details =
EmulatorPkg is very similar in many respects to the [[Nt32Pkg]],
but it should be generic enough to replace both [[Nt32Pkg]] and
[[UnixPkg]].

This task would be to enable a Windows host environment for
EmulatorPkg so we can consider deprecating Nt32Pkg and UnixPkg
in favor of using EmulatorPkg.

= Development environment =
Building: This project most likely would be completed on
Windows with Visual Studio C++.

It would also be desireable to be able to support building
and running the Windows host on Linux by building with mingw
and running under Wine.  Therefore, it would also be possible
to develop this project under Linux.

Testing: Run the emulator on Windows or with Wine.

= Sub-goals =
Some possible sub-goals for the driver
* Enter SEC phase of EmulatorPkg boot
* Enter PEI phase of EmulatorPkg boot
* Enter DXE phase of EmulatorPkg boot
* Enable multi-threading support
* Enable networking support

= Further Discussion =
Please discuss the project on [[edk2-devel]].
