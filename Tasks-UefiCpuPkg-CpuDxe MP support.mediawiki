= Details =

= Documentation =

Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1

http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html

= Development environment =
Building: This project can be completed on any edk2 supported OS or toolchain.

Any assembly code should be ported to all assembly formats.

= Test environments =

* OVMF: With QEMU you can use the -smp parameter to enable multiple processors
* DUET: With DUET you can run on a system with multiple threads/cores/processors

= Sub-goals =
Some possible sub-goals for the driver
* Successfully start up other processor (Startup IPI)
* <s>Transition from 16-bit real to 32-bit flat mode</s> (see ap-startup-example below)
* <s>Transition from 16-bit real to 64-bit long mode</s> (see ap-startup-example below)
* <s>AP starts running CpuDxe code</s> (see ap-startup-example below)
* AP can run code requested by MpService protocol (StartupAllAPs/StartupThisAP)
** See StartCore below
* Support for remaining MpService protocol functions
* <s>Dynamically update ACPI tables in OVMF based on number of processors</s>
* Refer to "Software Developer's Manual" to research further initialization requirements.

= Getting Started =
* Code to start from: https://github.com/jljusten/edk2/tree/ap-startup-example
** This code already starts the APs. This should provide most assembly code needed for this task.
** Tested with QEMU/OVMF on Linux
* The StartCore project provides a sample program that uses the MpServices protocol
** https://svn.code.sf.net/p/edk2-startcore/code/StartCorePkg (svn)
* [[EmulatorPkg]] already supports MpServices, so this may be used as a reference.

= Further Discussion =
This project would be for an edk2 based driver, so please discuss the project on [[edk2-devel]]. For IRC, #edk2 on [http://www.oftc.net irc.oftc.net].
