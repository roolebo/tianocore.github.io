# EDK II Continuous Integration

Summary of pre-commit and post-commit Continuous Integration services that
improve the quality of commits made to EDK II repositories.  The sections below
list the Continuous Integration services that are active and plans for future
enhancements and extensions to these services.

## Phase 1 (edk2 repository only) - Activated November 11, 2019

1) Use a combination of GitHub, Azure Pipelines, Mergify, and edk2-pytool features.
   * GitHub Pull Requests + Labels, Branch Protections,  Notifications
   * Mergify Pull Request Rules with auto commit if all checks pass
   * 3 pre-commit jobs in Azure Pipelines (PatchCheck, Windows/VS, Linux/GCC).
     Goal is to complete all pre-commits check in under 10 minutes.
   * 2 post-commit jobs in Azure Pipelines (Windows/VS, Linux/GCC).  Post commit
     status provided at top of `edk2/master` [Readme.md](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/Readme.md).
   * [EDK II Pytool Library](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library)
   * [EDK II Pytool Extensions](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions)
   * [TianoCore Bugzilla #2315](https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2315)
   * Original RFC Proposals
     - https://edk2.groups.io/g/rfc/message/93
     - https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/46607
2) Enable the following pre-commit checks
   * [PatchCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/BaseTools/Scripts/PatchCheck.py)
   * [CharEncodingCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/CharEncodingCheck)
   * [CompilerPlugin](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/CompilerPlugin)
   * [DependencyCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/DependencyCheck)
   * [DscCompleteCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/DscCompleteCheck)
   * [GuidCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/GuidCheck)
   * [LibraryClassCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/LibraryClassCheck)
   * [SpellCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/SpellCheck)
3) TianoCore EDK II Maintainers Team permissions reduced from 'Write" to "Triage"
4) EDK II Maintainers must use GitHub pull request with 'push' label to request
   a branch to be strict rebase merged into `edk2/master`.  If all checks pass,
   then the patches in the pull request are automatically added to `edk2/master`.
   If any check fails, then email notifications are sent and details of the
   failure are available through Azure Pipelines test results.
5) Personal builds available to all EDK II developers using a GitHub pull
   request without the 'push' label set.  If all checks pass, then a notification
   email is sent and the pull request is closed.  If any checks fails, then
   email notifications are sent and the details of the failure are available
   through Azure Pipelines test results.
6) GitHub References

[[EDK II Continuous Integration Administration]]

## Proposed Pre-Commit Checks in Phase 2
* Verify Reviewed-by and Acked-by tags are present with correct maintainers
* Verify no non-ASCII characters in modified files
* Verify no binary files in set of modified files

## Proposed Pre-Commit Checks in Phase 3
* Run ECC on modified files
* Verify modified modules/libs build
* Run available Host Based tests against modified modules/libs

# Post Commit Checks
* Build all modules/libs/platforms that consume modified content

# Daily Builds
* Build critical packages
* Build critical platforms
* Verify that Doxygen Documentation can be generated

# Weekly Builds
* Build all packages
* Build all platforms
* Publish Doxygen Documentation to a web site

# Release Builds
* Same as weekly builds
* Full regression testing
* Publishes binary files to release pages

# Possible Continuous Integration Actions
* PatchCheck.py
* Verify Reviewed-by and Acked-by tags are maintainers
* Verify no non-ASCII characters in modified source files
* Verify no binary files in set of modified files
* Verify Package Dependency rules in modified files
* Verify modified modules/libs build
* Run Host Based tests against modified modules/libs
* cppcheck
* ECC (EFI Code Checker)
  + Difficult to address all warnings/issues/false positives reported

# Possible Platform Testing Actions
* OVMF
  + IA32 DXE boot tests
  + X64 DXE boot tests
  + ArmVirt QEMU boot tests
  + S3 enabled tests
  + SMM_REQUIRE enabled tests
  + Boot using both KVM and QEMU environments
  + HTTPS Boot Tests

    - UEFI Secure Boot testing of "signed but not recognized" images
    - UEFI Secure Boot testing of "signed and accepted" images
    - UEFI Secure Boot testing of "signed but blacklisted" images
  + Project that offers a python script that automates communicating with the
    UEFI shell over the emulated serial port. Used in downstream package builds,
    for packaging a pre-enrolled variable store template file.

# Future Enhancements
* Support non-maintainer GitHub Pull Requests that are submitted after code
  review is complete.  Maintainers must still be part of the review/approval
  process before the PR is run through pre-commit tests auto committed.
