[WhiskeylakeOpenBoardPkg](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/WhiskeylakeOpenBoardPkg) is an EDK II for UEFI platform firmware on 8th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors and chipsets (formerly [Whiskey Lake](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/135883/whiskey-lake.html) platforms). This specific package supports the Intel Whiskey Lake U RVP (reference validation platform), it can be used as a simple starting base to enable support for other boards.

This tree follows a "minimum platform" philosophy, providing boot to a UEFI compliant operating system using the minimum number of EDK II modules. The project uses the [Intel® Firmware Support Package (Intel® FSP)](https://github.com/IntelFsp/FSP/tree/master/CoffeeLakeFspBinPkg) for platform silicon initialization.
